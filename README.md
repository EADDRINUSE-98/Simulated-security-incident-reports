# Simulated Security Incident Reports

This repository showcases my ability to write security incident reports by documenting simulated incidents.  The reports contained within are fictional and for demonstration purposes only. They do not represent real security breaches or vulnerabilities.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to demonstrate my skills in:

* **Incident Analysis:** Analyzing the details of a simulated security incident to understand its scope and impact.
* **Report Writing:** Creating clear, concise, and professional security incident reports that include relevant information such as:
    * **Executive Summary:** A brief overview of the incident.
    * **Incident Timeline:** A chronological account of the events.
    * **Affected Systems/Data:** Identification of the systems or data impacted.
    * **Root Cause Analysis (Simulated):** A description of the simulated case of the incident.
    * **Impact Assessment:** An evaluation of the potential or realized impact.
    * **Containment and Eradication Steps (Simulated):**  Actions taken to contain and resolve the incident.
    * **Recommendations:** Suggestions for preventing similar incidents in the future.
* **Technical Proficiency:**  Demonstrating an understanding of common security threats and vulnerabilities.

## Contents

Each incident report is contained within its own directory.  The naming convention for each directory is `incident-XX`, where:

* `XX` is a sequential number for incidents (e.g., 01, 02, etc.).

Within each directory, you will find:

* `report.md`: The security incident report in Markdown format.
* `scenario.md`: The file describing scenario of the incident (also simulated). This is the primary document to review.
