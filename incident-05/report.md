# Report

| Summary      | Recently our organization experienced a network access outage for 2 hours. Upon inspecting the network logs, it was found that a DDoS attack was performed by sending an overwhelming amount of ICMP pings to the network. As we investigated further, we found that a malicious actor sent a flood of ICMP packets into the internal network of the organization through an unconfigured firewall. Which resulted in an outage of the internal network and business work halt. |

| **Identify** | The cybersecurity team investigated the event and it was found that the malicious actor was able to flood the internal network through ICMP packets. Due to which employees were unable to access the network resources for their daily tasks. The ICMP packets were from multiple sources, which indicates that this attack was likely a DDoS attack.                                                                                                                          |
| **Protect**  | To prevent this attack from repeating in future, the network security team will implement following safeguards:<br><br>- A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets.<br>    <br>- Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets.<br>    <br>- An IPS to filter ICMP packets with malicious characteristics.                                                                                     |
| **Detect**   | To detect such attack in the future, the network security team will implement following measures:<br><br>- A network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns.<br>    <br>- An IDN to detect malicious packets across the network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Respond**  | In response to the DDoS attack, the incident management team blocked all incoming ICMP packets, stopping all non-critical network resources and services, and immediately restoring critical network resources and services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Recover**  | The security team will restore all affected network resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |


**Reflections/Notes:** This attack occurred due to a misconfigured firewall. It is recommended to review every firewall's configurations, and to maintain a base-line configuration directory for all the network security devices.
